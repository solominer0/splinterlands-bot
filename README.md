# splinterlands-bot

This is a fork of alfficcadenti's BOT to play the game [Splinterlands](https://www.splinterlands.com)

Changes have been made to resolve package conflicts, and to resolve script time outs/stops

## index.js

run `npm start index.js`

to start BOT login routine. username and password needs to be specified in the file .env in the root as variable like:
`ACCOUNT=yourhiveusername
PASSWORD=yourhiveprivatepostingkey`
Create .env text file with the above in the working directory of the splinterlands bot and add .env text file to .gitignore
